### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a driven and enthusiastic programmer and designer. With my robust background in computer science and mathematics, combined with my interest in art and UI/UX, my goal is to design and create professional software.

I'm currently working on [Cardium](https://github.com/levente-varga/Cardium) as my MSc thesis project. In the meantime, [Tower](https://github.com/levente-varga/Tower) and [Melodica](https://github.com/levente-varga/Melodica) are on hold.

Feel free to check out my finished projects, [Graphs](https://github.com/levente-varga/Graphs), [Weave](https://github.com/weave-game/weave) and my own [JSON parser](https://github.com/levente-varga/JsonParser) as well!
